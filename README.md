Massive power outages cause chaos for the general public and they cost utility providers a lot but this wouldnâ€™t be too much of a hassle if those power outages were rare. But outages affecting more than 50,000 people have increased dramatically in the recent years. This project mainly aims at using machine learning and smart grid technologies to improve the reliability and efficiency of power grids. This solution coincides with the SDG Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy.
